bootstrap.scss
==============

Yet another SASS port of Twitter's Bootstrap CSS toolkit.


Why there's no Makefile or docs?
--------------------------------

It's not supposed to be Twitter's Bootstrap alternative. It's just port of its
LESS files to SASS keeping them almost identical. You can simply drop this SASS
version into your Rails app to keep your "technologies' zoo" as small as
possible :))

For docs and javascript files and everything else you can use original repo.

This repo is just about SASS port of LESS part of the framework and nothing
more. ;))


Why SASS, when it was LESS?
---------------------------

* Because I prefer SASS over LESS.
* Because I want to have one technology per task in my projects (e.g. for RoR
  based projects).
